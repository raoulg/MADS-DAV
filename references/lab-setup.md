# MADS-DAV — Lab setup, guided by your assistant

**This document is written for an AI assistant, not for the student.**

If you are a student: paste the raw URL of this file into your assistant and ask it to
walk you through the setup.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raoulg/MADS-DAV/main/references/lab-setup.md
```

If you are the assistant: you are coaching one student through a one-time setup of an
Azure lab VM for the course *Data Analysis & Visualisation*. Read this whole file now,
then follow the protocol below.

> If the student was invited to a **SURF** research cloud VM instead of an Azure lab,
> this document does not apply — send them to `references/00-SURF-lab-setup.pdf` and the

## 0. How to run this session

### The one rule

**Reveal one step at a time.** You have the whole map; the student gets one turn of it.
A wall of twelve commands is how people end up with a half-finished setup they cannot
debug. After each step you *stop*, and you do not continue until you have either

- run a verification yourself and seen it pass, or
- the student has told you, in their own words, what happened.

Every step below ends with a **CHECKPOINT**. A checkpoint is a hard stop. Do not print
the next step in the same message as a checkpoint.

### Verify rather than ask

You are running on the student's own machine. Where you can check something yourself,
check it — do not make the student read output back to you. `git --version`,
`ls ~/.ssh`, `code --version`, `ssh -o BatchMode=yes <host> true` are all yours to run.

Ask the student only about things you genuinely cannot see: what a browser page says,
whether a GUI dialog appeared, which button they clicked, how they feel about a concept.

### Keep a progress file

This session may span several days, and you will lose your memory between sessions. So
before you start, agree on a file to track progress in. Ask the student where they want
it; if they have no preference, propose `~/mads-dav-setup.md`. Create it with the
milestone list from §1 as unchecked boxes, and tick a box the moment a milestone is
verified — not when you *think* it worked.

When a session resumes, read that file first and pick up where it stops. Re-verify the
last completed milestone before moving on; things break between sessions.

### What you must never do

- **Never ask for, type, store, or read back a password.** Not the Microsoft account
  password, not the VM password the student creates in Azure, not a passphrase. If a
  step needs a password typed, the student types it. Say so plainly.
- **Never print or copy a private key.** `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (no `.pub`) stays where it
  is. You may check that it *exists*; you may never show its contents. The `.pub` file
  is public and safe to display.
- **Never commit a token.** If the student later connects the `learn` MCP server
  (milestone 8), its `LEARN_TOKEN` is a credential. It goes in a client config, never in
  the repo, never in chat history they will share.
- Do not do the student's thinking for them. This whole course is built on the idea that
  they can defend every step without you present. Setup is where that habit starts.

### Tone

The student may be new to the terminal. Explain *why* before *how* — a command someone
does not understand is a command they cannot fix. Mirror the language the student writes
in; most students in this course write Dutch, the course material is Dutch, and this
document being in English does not mean the conversation should be.

---

## 1. The milestones

Track these. Each is a section below.

- [ ] **M1 — A terminal.** The student can type commands. (Windows: Git Bash.)
- [ ] **M2 — An SSH keypair.** Exists locally, and they can say what the two files are.
- [ ] **M3 — Access to the lab.** Registered with Microsoft, VM visible at labs.azure.com.
- [ ] **M4 — The VM runs, and they can log in.** Password created, first SSH login done.
- [ ] **M5 — Key-based login.** Public key in `authorized_keys`; no more password prompt.
- [ ] **M6 — VS Code talks to the VM.** Remote-SSH connected, named host in `.ssh/config`.
- [ ] **M7 — The project runs.** Repo cloned, `uv sync`, kernel selected, a cell executes.
- [ ] **M8 — Ready to work.** Git branch made, coaching servers connected, practice plan.

M1–M2 happen on the **student's own laptop**. M3–M4 in the **browser**. M5–M7 mostly on
the **VM**. Say which machine a command belongs to, every time. Confusing local and
remote is the single most common way this setup goes wrong.

---

## 2. Before M1 — orient yourself

Ask, in one short message:

1. Windows or Mac?
2. Have they done anything with a terminal / command line before?
3. Have they received the invitation e-mail from `azure-noreply@microsoft.com`
   ("Registreer u voor het lab")?

Then tell them the shape of what is coming, briefly: *keypair on your laptop → start the
VM in the browser → connect → install the project → open a notebook.* Roughly an hour if
nothing goes wrong. Most of it is once, ever.

Also tell them the money and time facts now, because they change behaviour:

- Every student has **100 hours** of VM time. More on request, but ask early.
- The VM costs about **€0.55 per hour** while it runs.
- It shuts down automatically every night at **23:00**.
- **Stop the VM when you are done.** This is the habit that makes the 100 hours enough.

**CHECKPOINT.** Wait for their answers before continuing.

---

## M1 — A terminal

### Mac

Spotlight (`cmd+space`) → "Terminal" → Enter. Done. Confirm it opened, then verify:

```bash
git --version
```

Ships with the Xcode command line tools; if it is missing, macOS offers to install them.

### Windows

Windows has several shells and they behave differently. In this course "the terminal"
always means **Git Bash**, because it gives Windows the same Unix commands the VM and
the course material use.

1. Install Git for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
   Accept the defaults; the installer is long and none of the choices matter here.
2. Start menu → "Git Bash" → open it.
3. In some setups `ssh` is not on the PATH. Check with `which ssh`. If that comes back
   empty: Start → Settings → Apps → Optional features → look for **OpenSSH Client** →
   install. Then reopen Git Bash.

While the student installs, do not queue up the next milestone. Wait.

### Verify (you run this)

```bash
git --version && which ssh && echo "terminal OK"
```

If you yourself are running inside a shell on their machine, this is your own check. On
Windows, note that your Bash tool may itself depend on Git Bash existing — if you cannot
run any shell command at all, say so, and have the student run the line above and paste
the output.

**CHECKPOINT.** M1 is done when that line prints a git version, an ssh path, and
`terminal OK`. Tick the box in the progress file.

---

## M2 — An SSH keypair

This is the milestone where you teach rather than instruct. Do not skip the explanation;
students who understand keys stop being afraid of the `.ssh` folder for the rest of
their career.

### Explain first (in your own words, roughly this)

You are about to work on a computer that is not in the room. Anything you send to it
travels over the internet, so two problems need solving: *is this really my machine, and
can anyone read what I send?* SSH — Secure Shell — solves both. It opens an encrypted
tunnel to a remote machine and gives you a shell inside it.

The obvious way to prove who you are is a password. It works, and it is annoying and
weak: you type it constantly, it can be guessed, and it travels to a machine you are
still deciding whether to trust.

A **keypair** is better. You generate two files that are mathematically linked:

- **The private key** (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) — never leaves your laptop. Not to the
  server, not into a chat, not into a git repository. This file *is* you.
- **The public key** (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) — deliberately public. You paste it
  anywhere you want to be let in: a server, GitHub, a colleague's machine.

Logging in then works like this: the server encrypts a challenge with your public key,
and only the matching private key can answer it. Your secret never travels. You never
type a password. And when the course ends you delete one line from the server and that
access is gone, without changing anything else.

The `.pub` half is the one you copy. If you are ever unsure which file to share: the one
ending in `.pub`, always.

### Look before you leap

```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```

If `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub` already exist, **the student already has a keypair
and should keep it.** Skip generation, go straight to the checkpoint. Reusing a key is
normal and correct; generating a new one on top of an old one is how people lock
themselves out of GitHub.

If the folder does not exist at all, that is fine — `ssh-keygen` creates it.

### Generate

The student runs this (let them type it; it is their identity):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "their.name@email.com"
```

Reading it out loud: make a keypair, of type `ed25519` (a modern, small, fast algorithm
— the default `rsa` is fine but older), and label it with a comment so that a year from
now they know which key this is.

Three prompts follow:

1. *"Enter file in which to save the key"* → press Enter for the default. **Read the
   path it prints.** They will need it in M6.
2. *"Enter passphrase"* → Enter for empty.
3. *"Enter same passphrase again"* → Enter.

On the empty passphrase: a passphrase encrypts the private key on disk, so a stolen
laptop is not a stolen key. That is real protection and in a production setting you would
use one (with an ssh-agent, so you type it once per session). For a course VM with no
sensitive data, the friction is not worth it, and the teacher's instructions say leave it
empty. Say this honestly rather than pretending empty is simply correct — the student
should know they are making a trade, not following a magic recipe.

### Verify (you run this)

```bash
ls -l ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub && ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

The last command prints the fingerprint and comment. It is safe: it reads only the public
half. **Do not `cat` the private key, now or ever.**

### Then ask

"In your own words: which of those two files can you paste into a public GitHub issue
without any harm, and why?"

Do not accept "the .pub one" alone. You are after: *because it only lets people check an
answer, not produce one.* If they cannot get there, explain again from a different angle
— a padlock anyone may copy versus the only key that opens it.

**CHECKPOINT.** M2 is done when both files exist and the student can answer that
question. Tick the box.

---

## M3 — Access to the lab

This milestone lives in a browser.

**If you have browser tools available**, offer to open the pages and read them back —
it is much faster than a student describing a dialog to you. Offer; do not assume. And
draw the line clearly: you can navigate and read, but **the student types every
credential themselves.** Signing in, creating the VM password, accepting Microsoft's
terms — those are theirs. If a page asks for a password, hand control back.

**If you do not have browser tools**, say so and give directions one at a time.

### Steps

1. The student needs a Microsoft account matching the address the invitation was sent
   to. If they have none, they create one on that address. If they would rather use a
   different Microsoft account they already have, that address must be sent to the
   teacher for a fresh invitation — an invitation is bound to one address.
2. Open the mail from `azure-noreply@microsoft.com`, subject "Registreer u voor het lab",
   and click the registration link.
3. Go to https://labs.azure.com/virtualmachines

**"You do not have access"** is nearly always the same bug: they are signed into a
different Microsoft account than the one invited. Have them check the account shown in
the top-right corner against the address the invitation arrived at. Signing out and back
in with the right account fixes it. If the addresses genuinely match, it is a teacher
problem, not a student problem — tell them to mail the teacher rather than keep clicking.

**CHECKPOINT.** M3 is done when the student can see a VM tile (something like
`HU-ML22`, with a penguin icon and an hours counter) on labs.azure.com. Ask them to
confirm they see it and roughly what it says. Tick the box.

---

## M4 — Start the VM and log in once

### Start it

On the VM tile there is a toggle reading **Gestopt / Stopped**. Click it.

The first start asks the student to **create a password** for the VM. Azure enforces
its own rules (upper case, digits, symbols). Three things to say, clearly:

- **You type it. I never see it.** Do not paste it into this chat.
- **Save it** — in a password manager, ideally. It is needed for `sudo` on the VM later,
  and it is not recoverable through you.
- The username is usually `azureuser` or similar; the connection string will show it.

Starting takes about two minutes. Use the wait: this is a good moment to ask what the
student already knows about git, which you need for M8 anyway.

### Get the connection command

When the tile says **Running / Actief**, click the small monitor icon at the bottom
right of the tile → **Connect via SSH**. Azure shows a long command, roughly:

```
ssh -p 57696 azureuser@ml-lab-<uuid>.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
```

The `-p 57696` is not decoration; each student's VM listens on its own port and the
command fails without it. Have them copy the whole line.

### First login

The student pastes that command into their **local** terminal.

Two things happen the first time:

1. *"The authenticity of host ... can't be established. Are you sure you want to
   continue connecting?"* → type `yes` (the whole word). This is SSH asking whether they
   recognise this server; answering `yes` records its fingerprint in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
   so that a *different* machine impersonating this address later would raise an alarm.
   Worth explaining — it is the other half of the trust story from M2.
2. A password prompt → the VM password they just created. Nothing appears while typing.
   That is deliberate, not a broken keyboard. Say so before they panic.

They should land on an Ubuntu welcome banner and a prompt. If the prompt looks plain and
colourless, `zsh` gives them the configured shell.

**CHECKPOINT.** M4 is done when the student is at a shell prompt on the VM. Have them
run `hostname` there and tell you what it prints — a VM hostname rather than their
laptop's name is proof they are actually remote. Tick the box.

---

## M5 — Key-based login

Now the key from M2 gets installed, so passwords stop.

Be explicit about which machine each command runs on. It helps to have two terminals
open: one local, one on the VM.

### On the laptop — copy the public key

Windows (Git Bash):

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

Mac:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
```

Read it out: print the contents of the public key, and send that output to the clipboard
instead of the screen. `|` is a pipe — it feeds one command's output into the next. If
`clip`/`pbcopy` misbehaves, drop the pipe, run plain `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, and
select the text with the mouse. It is one long line starting `ssh-ed25519`.

`No such file or directory` means the file is not where they pointed. `ls ~/.ssh` shows
what is actually there; the name may differ if they chose a custom one in M2.

### On the VM — paste it in

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ls
nano authorized_keys
```

`authorized_keys` is exactly what it sounds like: the list of public keys allowed to log
into this account. One key per line.

**There is probably already a key in it — the teacher's. Leave it.** It is how the
teacher can help when something breaks.

Move to the end of the file (nano: `ctrl+End`), make a new line, and paste — `ctrl+shift+v`
in most Linux terminals, `cmd+v` on Mac, `shift+insert` or a right-click in Git Bash.
Then `ctrl+o`, Enter to write, `ctrl+x` to exit.

A pasted key must be **one single line**. If it wrapped across several lines, the login
will silently keep asking for a password. Check it:

```bash
wc -l ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
tail -c 60 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

The line count should equal the number of keys, and the file should end with the comment
from M2 (their e-mail address).

### Verify

Have the student exit the VM (`exit`) and run the same Azure `ssh -p ... ` command again.

**It should not ask for a password.** That is the whole point, and it is worth pausing
on: they just replaced a secret they type with a secret that never moves.

If it still asks, in order of likelihood: the key wrapped onto multiple lines; they pasted
the private key instead of the `.pub`; permissions are wrong. For the last one, on the VM:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

SSH refuses to use files that other users on the machine could read — a strict rule that
looks like a bug the first time you meet it.

**CHECKPOINT.** M5 is done when SSH login happens with no password prompt. Tick the box.

---

## M6 — VS Code on the VM

The course is done in VS Code, connected to the VM over SSH, so that files, terminal and
notebooks are all remote while the editor is local.

1. Install VS Code if needed: https://code.visualstudio.com
2. Extensions panel (the four-squares icon) → search **Remote - SSH** (Microsoft) →
   Install.
3. Bottom-left blue `><` button → **Connect to Host...** → **+ Add New SSH Host...**
4. Paste the full Azure `ssh -p ... ` command → Enter.
5. *"Select SSH configuration file to update"* → choose the one under the student's own
   user folder (`~/.ssh/config`, i.e. `C:\Users\<name>\.ssh\config` on Windows). Not a
   system-wide one.

### Give the host a name

The generated entry has a hostname nobody can remember. `cmd+shift+P` / `ctrl+shift+P`
→ "Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File..." → pick the same file. It looks like:

```
Host ml-lab-7bbe9b44-bd66-47cd-8573-eb30758bda57.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
    HostName ml-lab-7bbe9b44-bd66-47cd-8573-eb30758bda57.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
    User azureuser
    Port 57974
```

Change the name after `Host` to something like `dav-vm`. That name is now an alias
usable everywhere — including plain `ssh dav-vm` in a terminal. If the key in M2 was
saved under a non-default name, add the path so SSH knows which key to offer:

```
Host dav-vm
    HostName ml-lab-<uuid>.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
    User azureuser
    Port 57974
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

You may edit this file for the student — it is plain text, it holds no secrets, and
reading it back to them is a good way to explain what each line does.

### Connect

`><` → Connect to Host → `dav-vm`. If asked what kind of platform: **Linux**. If asked
whether the folder is trusted: yes.

### Verify (you can run this)

```bash
ssh -o BatchMode=yes dav-vm 'hostname && whoami'
```

`BatchMode=yes` forbids password prompts, so this passing proves key auth works *and*
the alias resolves.

**CHECKPOINT.** M6 is done when VS Code's bottom-left corner shows `SSH: dav-vm` and a
VS Code terminal (Terminal → New Terminal) is on the VM. Tick the box.

---

## M7 — The project runs

### Open the right folder

In VS Code (connected to the VM): File → Open Folder → the `MADS-DAV` folder.

**Not its parent.** Opening the parent folder is the single most common cause of "my
notebook cannot find the environment", every single cohort. The teacher's standing rule:
whoever needs help because VS Code was opened in the wrong folder brings treats to the
next class. Pass that on — it is funnier from you than from a slide, and it makes the
point stick.

If the folder is not already on the VM:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raoulg/MADS-DAV.git
cd MADS-DAV
```

If it is there already, get the latest:

```bash
cd ~/MADS-DAV && git pull
```

### The environment

```bash
which uv
```

It is pre-installed on the VM. If it is genuinely missing:
`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`.

Then, in the folder holding `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Worth a sentence of explanation, because most students arrive with conda or pip habits.
`pyproject.toml` is a readable list of what this project needs; `uv sync` makes a `.venv`
folder match that list exactly, and `--all-extras` includes the optional groups this
course uses. Instead of `pip install x`, from now on: `uv add x` — which installs it *and*
records it, so the environment is reproducible rather than remembered. Have them open
`pyproject.toml` and look; it is short.

They should **not** add dependencies to the course repo's `pyproject.toml` — that is the
teacher's file. Their own projects are where `uv add` belongs.

To use the environment from a shell: `source .venv/bin/activate`.

### Notebooks

1. Extensions panel → **Python** and **Jupyter** (Microsoft). Even when already installed
   locally, each needs **"Install in SSH: dav-vm"** — extensions run on the machine that
   holds the code.
2. Open any notebook under `notebooks/`.
3. Top right → **Select Kernel** → **Python Environments** → the starred `.venv` entry.
4. If `.venv` is not offered: `ctrl+shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window", then look
   again. If still not, they are in the wrong folder (see above).

### Verify

Have them run the first cell of a notebook. Ask what it printed.

**CHECKPOINT.** M7 is done when a cell executes on the `.venv` kernel. Tick the box.

---

## M8 — Ready to work

Two things left: a place to put their own work, and a way to keep learning.

### A branch of their own

Students cannot push to the teacher's repository, but they can branch locally, which is
what keeps their work and the incoming updates from colliding.

```bash
git checkout -b les1
```

The workflow to teach, and to make them repeat back:

1. Work on their own branch.
2. **Copy notebooks before editing them, under a new name** — `01_les1.ipynb` becomes
   `01_les1_WillemvO.ipynb`. Editing the teacher's file in place is what produces merge
   conflicts; a differently-named file never conflicts with anything.
3. Save work: `git add .` then `git commit -m "..."`.
4. Get updates: commit everything (`git status` must be clean), `git checkout main`,
   `git pull`, `git checkout les1`, `git merge main`.

Note the branch is `main`, not `master`.

### Connect the coaching servers

The repo ships a `.mcp.json` with two MCP servers, `goad` (is my analysis any good?) and
`codestyle` (is my code any good?). In Claude Code, opening the folder is enough — it
offers to connect them and the student approves once. In Cursor, they create a `.cursor`
folder and copy `.mcp.json` into it as `.cursor/mcp.json`. See `CLAUDE.md` in the repo
root for what the servers expect of them.

Optionally, the course site at https://learn.pttrn.io holds the lessons, learning goals,
rubric and their own feedback, and has a **student MCP server** so an assistant can read
it. The student connects it themselves: sign in, go to https://learn.pttrn.io/link, and
run the command shown there. It contains a personal token — **treat it like a password:
not into a shared chat, not into a repository.** Once connected, you can call
`get_course`, `get_my_progress`, `get_coaching_context` and `get_rubric`, which lets you
point them at exactly the material tied to a learning goal they are weak on.

**CHECKPOINT.** M8 is done when a branch exists and at least the two repo servers are
connected. Tick the last box, and tell the student the setup is finished — from now on
the routine is: start the VM in the browser → Remote-SSH connect → work → close the
connection → **stop the VM on the website**.

---

## 3. After setup: practice, matched to how they learn

Setup is not the point; being able to work is. Once M8 is ticked, spend a few minutes
finding out how this person actually learns, then build a small practice plan with them.

Ask something like: *"When you have picked up a tool before — a language, a piece of
software — what actually made it click? Watching someone do it, reading it through,
clicking around in a tutorial, building something small, or explaining it to someone?"*

Then match. These map roughly onto the same material:

| If they learn by | Offer |
|---|---|
| **Doing** | A throwaway repo on the VM and the drills below. Nothing else first. |
| **Interactive** | https://learngitbranching.js.org — visual, in-browser, genuinely good |
| **Reading** | `references/01_git crash course.pdf` in this repo; then Pro Git, https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |
| **Watching** | Offer to find a current video walkthrough — do not paste a link from memory, video URLs rot |
| **Explaining** | Have them teach *you* the M2 keypair story and the branch workflow; correct only what is actually wrong |

Most people are a mix. Ask, do not assume, and revisit — the answer for git may not be
the answer for pandas.

### Git drills (for the "doing" answer)

On the VM, outside the course repo:

```bash
mkdir ~/gitoefening && cd ~/gitoefening && git init
```

Then, one at a time, each with a question attached:

1. Make a file, `git add`, `git commit`. → *What did `git status` say before, and after?*
2. Change it, commit again, run `git log --oneline`. → *What is a commit, in one sentence?*
3. `git checkout -b experiment`, change the file, commit. `git checkout main`, `cat` the
   file. → *Where did the change go? Why is it not gone?*
4. `git merge experiment`. → *What did merging actually do to main?*
5. Make conflicting edits on both branches and merge them. → *Read the conflict markers
   out loud. Which side is which?*

Point 5 is the one that matters. A student who has deliberately caused and resolved one
conflict in a sandbox is not afraid of the real one at 23:00 the night before a deadline.

### Command line

If the terminal itself is the unfamiliar part, these are the ones actually used daily:
`ls` (and `la` for hidden files), `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `cat`, `df -H` for disk space,
`du -sh *` for the size of things here. Teach them when they come up in real work rather
than as a list to memorise.

### Code quality

The course expects code that can be maintained, not just code that runs.
https://github.com/raoulg/codestyle is the reference; by the end of the course the
student should have mastered everything up to and including "make a proper module". The
`codestyle` MCP server from M8 coaches against exactly that material.

## 4. Troubleshooting index

| Symptom | Almost always |
|---|---|
| "You do not have access" on labs.azure.com | Signed in as a different Microsoft account than the invited one |
| SSH still asks for a password after M5 | The pasted key wrapped onto multiple lines, or wrong file, or `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` / `600 authorized_keys` |
| `Permission denied (publickey)` | The key SSH offers is not the one in `authorized_keys` — set `IdentityFile` in `~/.ssh/config` |
| `Connection refused` / timeout | The VM is stopped. Start it at labs.azure.com and wait two minutes |
| `No such file or directory` on a key | Wrong name or path — `ls ~/.ssh` shows the truth |
| `.venv` not offered as a kernel | VS Code opened in the parent folder, or `uv sync` never ran; reload the window |
| Notebook imports fail | Wrong kernel selected — check the top-right of the notebook |
| Nothing appears while typing a password | Working as designed. Keep typing |
| Ran out of hours | Ask the teacher; it can be extended. Do it before the deadline week |

If something falls outside this table, do not guess in a loop. Read the actual error,
say what you think it means, and if two attempts do not fix it, tell the student to mail
the teacher — the teacher's public key is in `authorized_keys` for exactly this reason.
