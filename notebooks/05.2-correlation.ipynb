We are trying to get a better grip on correlation, and which features contain relevant information. We might already have decided we are going to use a random forest, or a neural network, or whatever fits our goal, or we might not have decided yet. In using a linear regression model, we are going to use regularization, and we are going to read out the weights of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "These weights is what we are actually interested in, because it will tell us something about how informative the models are. If a weight is zero, it means that the feature is not used in the model. If a weight is high, it means that the feature is used a lot in the model. If a weight is negative, it means that the feature is used inversely in the model.\n",

The mean squared error is a common loss function, that calculates the average of the squared differences between the predictions and the actual values:\n",
