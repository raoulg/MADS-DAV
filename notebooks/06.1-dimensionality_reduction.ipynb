    "# SVD and PCA\n",
    "Singular Value Decomposition, or SVD for short, is a mathematical technique that decomposes a matrix into three simpler matrices. Imagine you have a large, complex puzzle; SVD helps you break it down into smaller, easier-to-understand pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Value Decomposition (SVD) is defined like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = U \\Sigma V^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "U (left singular vectors): This is a matrix that contains information about the patterns and relationships between the rows of the original matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Σ (singular values): This is a diagonal matrix with non-negative numbers, which can be seen as the \"strength\" or \"importance\" of each pattern found by U and V. The singular values are sorted from largest to smallest, showing the ranking of the importance of each pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "V^T (right singular vectors, transpose of V): This is a matrix that contains information about the patterns and relationships between the columns of the original matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some applications where you could encounter SVD?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data compression: SVD can help you reduce the size of the data without losing much information. By keeping only the largest singular values (and associated vectors), you can get a compact version of your original matrix.\n",
    "2. Noise reduction: SVD can help remove noise from data. In this context, noise is represented by the components with smaller singular values that you can discard, leaving you with the more significant, stronger signals in your data.\n",
    "3. Latent semantic analysis: In natural language processing, SVD is used to understand the relationships between documents and terms in text data, helping to find the hidden (or \"latent\") concepts.\n",
    "4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): In machine learning, SVD is used as part of PCA, which is a method that reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD is like a Swiss Army knife for matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of some terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "$U$ provides an orthonormal basis for the column space of $X$, and V provides an orthonormal basis for the row space of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some explanation of what an orthonormal basis means in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Orthogonal*: Each line is at a 90-degree angle to the others, like the corners of a room. One line goes from wall to wall, another from floor to ceiling, and another from one corner of the room to the opposite corner if it's a 3D space. They don't lean toward each other at all. This is how we typically think of axis lines in a graph. Note that they don't NEED to be at a 90 degree angle, but it doesnt make much sense to have them at any other angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Normalized*: Each line has been stretched or shrunk to exactly the same length. Let's say we've decided that the length is the length of a meter stick. So, if you were to walk from the center of the room to the wall following one of these lines, you'd always walk exactly one meter, no matter which line you chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Basis*: Using these lines, you can reach any point in the room by walking along them one at a time. In a grid with 3D axis, the basis would be the vectors (0,0,1), (0,1,0) and (1,0,0). If you want to reach any point in the room, you can reach it by combining these three vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key characteristics of a basis are:\n",
    "- *Coverage*: A basis must be able to reach or \"span\" every point in the space. Just like with our north and east directions on the floor, by going some amount north and some amount east, you can reach any point on the floor. If you were in a three-dimensional room, you'd also need an up-and-down direction to reach every point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Independence*: The directions in a basis must be independent of each other, meaning you can't create one direction just by using a combination of the others. On our floor, you can't get a north direction just by walking east or vice versa; they're completely separate."
